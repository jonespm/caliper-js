****NOTICE: 1EdTech will be moving Caliper to private repositories on June 17, 2023. Access to the repositories will be available for 1EdTech Contributing Members and Affiliates.  We encourage you to get involved in 1EdTech to support the Caliper work and get certified for Caliper.****

The [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API&trade;) for marshalling and 
transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, analysis and use.  

*caliper-js* is a reference implementation of the Sensor API&trade; written in Javascript.

## Branches
* __master__: stable, deployable branch that stores the official release history.  
* __develop__: unstable development branch.  Current work that targets a future release is merged to 
this branch.

## Tags
*caliper-js* releases are tagged and versioned MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\[-label\] (e.g., 1.1.3).  
Pre-release 
tags are identified with an extensions label (e.g., "1.2.0-RC01").  The tags are stored in this repository.

## Contributing
We welcome the posting of issues by non IMS Global Learning Consortium members (e.g., feature 
requests, bug reports, questions, etc.) but we *do not* accept contributions in the form of pull 
requests from non-members. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more 
information.

## Getting started
1. *Read* the [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1).  
2. Fork the IMS Global *caliper-js* project to your Github account and clone your copy to a local 
development machine.  
3. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and the Javascript package manager, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). 
Consider using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), a node version manager, to install Node.js and npm.   
4. Once npm is installed, change directories to where you cloned *caliper-js* and install the 
[browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [grunt-cli](https://gruntjs.com) packages globally before 
installing the *caliper-js* dependencies:

```
npm install -g browserify
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
``` 

## Performing a Build
Clone the IMS Global [caliper-common-fixtures](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/caliper-common-fixtures) 
repo at the same level as *caliper-js*. Then invoke [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) to execute the unit 
tests, generate [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/), and build the *caliper-js* library. 

```
grunt
```

The distribution file will be copied to `dist/caliperSensor-[MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH].js`.

## Caliper vocabulary
The [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
defines a set of concepts, relationships and rules for describing learning activities. Each activity 
domain modeled is described in a profile. Each profile is composed of one or more `Event` types 
(e.g., `AssessmentEvent`, `NavigationEvent`). Each `Event` type is associated with a set of actions 
undertaken by learners, instructors, and others. Various `Entity` types representing people, groups, 
and resources are provided in order to better describe both the relationships established between 
participating entities and the contextual elements relevant to the interaction (e.g., `Assessment`, 
`Attempt`, `CourseSection`, `Person`).

*caliper-js* implements all profiles described in 
[Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1). 

## Creating events and entities
A Caliper `Event` describes the relationship between two entities, one an `actor` and the other an 
`object`, formed as a result of a purposeful `action` undertaken by the actor at a particular moment 
in time and, optionally, situated within a given learning context.  Below is an example of an 
`AssessmentEvent` expressed as JSON-LD:

#### Example: AssessmentEvent
```json
{
  "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",

      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note the following requirements illustrated by the above example:

* Caliper events and entity *describes* are serialized as JSON-LD documents.  Each document must be 
provisioned with a JSON-LD `@context` that references, at a minimum, the remote IMS Caliper context 
document.  If you are unfamiliar with JSON-LD, consider pausing here and augmenting your Caliper 
knowledge by reading the [JSON-LD specification](http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/).
* The `Event` properties `id`, `type`, `actor`, `action`, `object` and `eventTime`are required; 
all other properties are considered optional.  The `id` value must be expressed as a UUID using the 
form `urn:uuid:<UUID>` per RFC 4122.  A version 4 UUID should be generated.  The `type` value must 
match the term specified by Caliper (e.g., "AssessmentEvent", "MessageEvent", "NavigationEvent").
* Caliper permits `Entity` values to be expressed either as a JSON object or as a string corresponding 
to the resource's IRI.  If the `Entity` is expressed as an object, both the `id` and `type` properties 
must be specified; all other properties are considered optional.  The `id` value must be expressed as 
an IRI. A URI using the URN scheme may be provided although care should be taken when employing a 
location-independent identifier since it precludes the possibility of utilizing it to retrieve 
machine-readable data over HTTP.  The `type` value must match the term specified by Caliper (e.g., 
"Person", "Assessment", "Attempt", "CourseSection").
* Date/Time properties (e.g., `eventTime`, `dateCreated`, `startedAtTime`) must be expressed as date 
and time values expressed with millisecond precision using the ISO 8601 format 
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ set to UTC with no offset specified.
* Custom attributes not described by Caliper may be included but must be added to the `extensions` 
property as a map of key:value pairs. 
* Properties with a value of null or empty are excluded by *caliper-js* during serialization.

See the The [Caliper Analytics&reg; Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) for a complete description of requirements.

## Factory methods
*caliper-js* provides two factory functions to simplify creating events and entities:

* *eventFactory()* returns a mutated `Event` object based on a *caliper-js* delegate to which is 
assigned an options object of user-provided key:value pairs. The function exposes a single method 
signature: *.create(delegate, opts)*.   
* *entityFactory()* returns a mutated `Entity` object based on a *caliper-js* delegate to which is 
assigned an options object of user-provided key:value pairs. The function exposes two method 
signatures: *.create(delegate, opts)* and *.coerce(delegate, opts)*.  Use the 
*.create(delegate, opts)* method to express a Caliper `Entity` as an object; use the 
*.coerce(delegate, opt)* method to express an `Entity` as a string that corresponds to its IRI.

#### Example: Creating an Assessment Expressed as an Object
```javascript
var obj = entityFactory().create(Assessment, {
  id: "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/assess/1",
  dateToStartOn: moment.utc("2018-08-16T05:00:00.000Z"),
  dateToSubmit: moment.utc("2018-09-28T11:59:59.000Z"),
  maxAttempts: 1,
  maxScore: 25.0
});
```

#### Example: Creating a SoftwareApplication Expressed as a String 
```javascript
var edApp = entityFactory().coerce(SoftwareApplication, {id: "http://example.edu"});

```

## Envelopes
Caliper `Event` and `Entity` data must be transmitted inside a Caliper `Envelope`, a JSON data 
structure that includes metadata about the emitting application sensor and the data payload. 
The `sensor`, `sendTime`, `dataVersion` and `data` properties are required.  The `data` array 
comprises an ordered collection of one or more Caliper `Event` and/or `Entity` *describe* documents. 
Each `Event` and `Entity` describe transmitted inside an `Envelope` must be serialized as a JSON-LD 
document.

#### Example: Caliper Envelope (single ToolUseEvent data payload)
```json
{
  "sensor": "https://example.edu/sensors/1",
  "sendTime": "2018-11-15T11:05:01.000Z",
  "dataVersion": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  "data": [{
    "@context": "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
    "id": "urn:uuid:7e10e4f3-a0d8-4430-95bd-783ffae4d916",
    "type": "ToolUseEvent",
    "actor": {
      "id": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
      "type": "Person"
    },
    "action": "Used",
    "object": {
      "id": "https://example.edu",
      "type": "SoftwareApplication"
    },
    "eventTime": "2018-11-15T10:15:00.000Z",
    "edApp": "https://example.edu",
    "group": {
      "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1",
      "type": "CourseSection",
      "courseNumber": "CPS 435-01",
      "academicSession": "Fall 2018"
    },
    "membership": {
      "id": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/rosters/1",
      "type": "Membership",
      "member": "https://example.edu/users/554433",
      "organization": "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1",
      "roles": ["Learner"],
      "status": "Active",
      "dateCreated": "2018-08-01T06:00:00.000Z"
    },
    "session": {
      "id": "https://example.edu/sessions/1f6442a482de72ea6ad134943812bff564a76259",
      "type": "Session",
      "startedAtTime": "2018-11-15T10:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }]
}
```

## Installing and using the library:
Install and build the *caliper-js* library per the steps above.  Then reference the *caliper-js* 
library inside the \<head\> tag of your HTML file:

```html
<head> 
  <script src="[path to]/caliperSensor-1.1.1.js"></script>
</head>
```

## Creating and sending Caliper messages
You can use *caliper-js* to create, serialize and transmit Caliper messages to a target endpoint over 
HTTP.  The HTTP connection must be secured and encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS).  Below 
is a snippet of code illustrating the steps required to create an `AssessmentEvent` and transmit it 
to a target endpoint: 

```javascript
// Initialize Caliper sensor
var sensor = Caliper.Sensor;
sensor.initialize("http://example.org/sensors/1");

// Override default HTTP options
var options = Caliper.Clients.HttpOptions;
options.uri = "https://example.edu/caliper/target/endpoint";
options.headers["Authorization"] = "40dI6P62Q_qrWxpTk95z8w";

// Initialize and register client
var client = Caliper.Clients.HttpClient;
client.initialize("http://example.org/sensors/1/clients/2", options);
sensor.registerClient(client);

// Set Event property values
// Note: only actor, action, and object property assignments shown
var actor = entityFactory().create(Person, {id: "https://example.edu/users/554433"});
var action = actions.started.term;
var obj = entityFactory().create(Assessment, {
  id: "https://example.edu/terms/201801/courses/7/sections/1/assess/1",
  dateToStartOn: moment.utc("2018-08-16T05:00:00.000Z"),
  dateToSubmit: moment.utc("2018-09-28T11:59:59.000Z"),
  maxAttempts: 1,
  maxScore: 25.0
  // ... add additional optional property assignments
});

// ... Use the entityFactory() to mint additional entity values.

// Create Event
var event = EventFactory().create(AssessmentEvent, {
  id: id,
  actor: actor,
  action: action,
  object: obj,
  eventTime: new Date().toISOString(),
  edApp: edApp,
  group: group,
  membership: membership,
  session: session
});

// ... Create additional events and/or entity describes.

// Create data payload
var payload = [];
payload.push(event);

// Envelope options
var opts = {
  sensor: sensor.id,
  sendTime: new Date().toISOString(),
  dataVersion: "http://purl.imsglobal.org/ctx/caliper/v1p1",
  data: payload
};

// Create envelope with data payload
var envelope = sensor.createEnvelope(opts);

// Delegate transmission responsibilities to client
sensor.sendToClient(client, envelope);
```
